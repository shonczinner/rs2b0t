// Why: eating consumes the tick it happens on, so landing it on the tick the weapon swings loses that attack while landing it anywhere in the cooldown costs nothing.
// Why: so the rule is narrow: hold for the one tick an attack started on, eat on any other.
// Why: safety wins over DPS, so an unknown attack tick or health low enough that a single hit could kill both eat immediately.
