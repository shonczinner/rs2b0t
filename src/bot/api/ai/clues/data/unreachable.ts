// Why: these are gaps in the nav data; the solver abandons cleanly and baking the crossing makes the clue work with no solver edit.
// Why: not consulted by the solver, so a pack fix takes effect on its own.
// Why: the audit allowlists these and the live harnesses use them to tell a known gap apart from a regression.
// Why: a row saying `crossed by` names the module that gets there without the pack (as Isafdar is crossed on the seam graph) and stays listed because no pack edge will ever open it.
// Why: the section markers below read NO QUEST (crossing exists, needs baking), QUEST (assumes the named quest complete, then needs baking), KIT (needs an item or skill), DEFECT (the pack or a generator is wrong).
// @see docs/reference/clues-gates.md#clues-the-pack-cannot-reach

    // Why: death_climbingrocks_top (3722) / _bottom (3723) sit at (2880..2881, 3594..3595) on the Death Plateau, ~80 tiles south of these digs and not on the route (#365, Content @ 088ca5e).
    // Why: the crossings bordering these digs are in quest_troll.rs2, troll_mountain_shortcut_climbingrocks1/2 (3803/3804) @ (2885,3683+3684) and (2887..2888,3661), Agility 15 only, no quest and no boots.
    // Why: troll_climbingrocks (3748) @ (2910,3686+3687) needs Agility 15 and %troll_quest >= ^troll_started (Troll Stronghold started; Death Plateau doesn't count); Climbing boots are demanded only when coordz(coord) = 3611, the far southern approach.
    // Why: 3526 / 3528 are absent because the Troll Stronghold route (#264) baked stile, the 3 secret-way rock climbs, the troll pass and the stronghold, joining Trollheim to the mainland graph at the cost of Agility 15 and worn Climbing boots for the (2856,3612) ascent.
    // Why: the 2 mountain shortcut rocks named above stayed unbaked because both their endpoints already sit inside that component.
