// Why: the solver reports the reason and abandons instead of walking until the navigator gives up.
// Why: the audit allowlists these instead of counting them as findings.
// Why: a clue belongs here only when a quest seals its destination; awkward walks don't count.
// Why: the journal is read at solve time, so an account that has finished the quest walks the clue instead of abandoning it.
