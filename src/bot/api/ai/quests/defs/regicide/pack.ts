// Why: The bankless middle has incompatible slot needs, so each leg declares its pack before entering the pass.
// Why: a plan is a whitelist plus a set of counts, because the deposit step can't keep a partial stack. An item with a target is left out of the deposit and drawn back, which settles in 3 cycles: shed, draw, done.

// Why: Plans are whitelists; keep replaceable quest items by default because replacing one can require another full pass crossing.
// Why: Iorwerth's letter is here only while it's owed to King Lathas: his reward branch reads it out of the pack and the quest is over, after which it's a slot, so a plan naming it in `shed` drops it.
// Why: Receiving the King's message advances the stage immediately, and no later script consumes it, so keeping it wastes a slot.
